# Unfinish-multi-fps
Project that i had try alone when i get free time which required 4-10 people, in RUST using bevy, i will later on, divide the main to make it clearer, still collider between walls and player to fix and make the whole multiplayer afterwards
I currently don't know if i'm gonna comeback into it in some months or more.
